    <h3>Who we serve</h3>

    <p>
    We serve our community. Our community is made up of players and creators of games. Our players typically
    reach us through this site or social media. Our creators are students learning to code, designers honing
    their craft, and people making a difference.
    </p>

    <h3>How we serve</h3>

    <p>We make Anti-Trump games easy to build. We use JavaScript and open source technology. We provide SDKs
    (Software Development Kits) to make game building fun and easy at any skill level.
    </p>

    <h3>Why we serve</h3>
    <p>Trump and his administration silence people. People in government, the media, the world. This
    is wrong. This is fascism.</p>
